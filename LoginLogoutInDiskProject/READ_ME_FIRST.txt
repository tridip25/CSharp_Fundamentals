A brief overview


In the command line it will ask you to create your account or Login(if you created already).

As soon as you are done creating it will store the details in a .txt file in disk.

Later on if you try to login to your account taking into consideration that all the
credentials are correct(it will match with the existing text file),
then it will display a message accordingly.

And if the credentials are wrong it won't show anything.
